##  Overview

The **Traceable Document Compressor** is a specialized analysis engine designed to compress complex PDF documents into structured, risk-aware intelligence briefs. 

Unlike standard AI summarizers, this tool injects **Traceability Beacons** (`[[P1_0]]`) into the source text before processing. This forces the AI to cite specific paragraph IDs for every claim, ensuring 100% verifiability and eliminating hallucinations.



##  Interface

### 1. The Executive Dashboard
*Real-time metrics for Risks, Source Coverage, and Compression Ratio.*

### 2. Source Verification (Traceability)
*Clicking a "Source" button instantly reveals the original paragraph from the PDF.*

##  Key Features

* ** Zero-Trust Traceability:** Every key point is linked to a specific paragraph ID (e.g., `[[P1_5]]`).
* ** Structured Intelligence:** Outputs strict JSON data, categorized into **Operational**, **Financial**, and **Legal** risks.
* ** Smart Compression:** Calculates real-time compression ratios (e.g., 10x reduction) while retaining critical context.
* ** Meta-Analysis Engine:** Automatically detects and reports **omitted themes**, assigning an "Impact Score" (Low(grey)/Medium(orange)/High(red)) to what was left out.
* ** Vector-Grounded Q&A:** A chat interface that answers questions based *strictly* on the document, citing tags as proofs.
* ** CoreOps UI:** A custom-styled "Dark Mode" interface built for readability and speed.
